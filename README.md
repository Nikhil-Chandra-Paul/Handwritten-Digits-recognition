# Handwritten-Digits-recognition
Handwritten Digits Recognition program in Python

It's divided into two parts 
a)Training Model
b)Gui for drawing out your digits

a)Training Model (model.py):

Import the necesssary modules in the model.py script.
It generates a trained model based on mnist data set.
After runninng,It would generate a mnist.h5 file,which basically is your trained model.

b)Gui part (main.py):

same thing import the necessary modules.
It loads the mnist.h5 model.
If you want,you can upload your own trained model.But don't forget , model signatures should match.
And after running it, you'll know what to do ;)
